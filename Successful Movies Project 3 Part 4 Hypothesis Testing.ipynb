    "> *For this project, you have been hired to produce a MySQL database on Movies from a subset of IMDB's publicly available dataset. Ultimately, you will use this database to analyze what makes a movie successful, and will provide recommendations to the stakeholder on how to make a successful movie.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of this project, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Part 1**: Download several files from IMDBâ€™s movie data set and filter out the subset of moves requested by the stakeholder.\n",
    "* **Part 2**: Use an API to extract box office revenue and profit data to add to your IMDB data and perform exploratory data analysis.\n",
    "* **Part 3**: Construct and export a MySQL database using your data.\n",
    "* **Part 4**: Apply hypothesis testing to explore what makes a movie successful.\n",
    "* **Part 5** (Optional): Produce a Linear Regression model to predict movie performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Questions to Answer\n",
    "* **The stakeholder's first question is: *Does the MPAA rating of a movie (G/PG/PG-13/R) affect how much revenue the movie generates?***\n",
    "\n",
    "   * They want you to perform a statistical test to get a mathematically-supported answer.\n",
    "   * They want you to report if you found a significant difference between ratings.\n",
    "      * If so, what was the p-value of your analysis?\n",
    "      * And which rating earns the most revenue?\n",
    "   * They want you to prepare a visualization that supports your finding.\n",
    "* **It is then up to you to think of 2 additional hypotheses to test that your stakeholder may want to know.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some example hypotheses you could test:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Do movies that are over 2.5 hours long earn more revenue than movies that are 1.5 hours long (or less)?\n",
    "   * Do movies released in 2020 earn less revenue than movies released in 2018?\n",
    "      * How do the years compare for movie ratings?\n",
    "   * Do some movie genres earn more revenue than others?\n",
    "   * Are some genres higher rated than others?\n",

    "### Specifications\n",
    "#### Your Data\n",
    "* A critical first step for this assignment will be to retrieve additional movie data to add to your SQL database.\n",
    "   * You will want to use the TMDB API again and extract data for additional years.\n",
    "   * You may want to review the optional lesson from Week 1 on \"Using glob to Load Many Files\" to load and combine all of your API results for each year.\n",
    "* **However, trying to extract the TMDB data for all movies from 2000-2022 could take >24 hours!**\n",
    "* **To address this issue, you should EITHER:**\n",
    "   * **Define a smaller (but logical) period of time** to use for your analyses (e.g. last 10 years, 2010-2019 (pre-pandemic, etc).\n",
    "   * **OR coordinate with cohort-mates and divide the API calls** so that you can all download the data for a smaller number of years and then share your downloaded JSON data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables\n",
    "* You should use the same project repository you have been using for Parts 1-3 (for your portfolio).\n",
    "   * Create a new notebook in your project repository just for the hypothesis testing (like \"Part 4 - Hypothesis Testing.ipynb\")\n",
    "   * Make sure the results and visualization for all 3 hypotheses are in your notebook.\n",
